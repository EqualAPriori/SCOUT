RPAFit.py contains all the functions for doing a variety of tasks around fitting,
S(q) data or generating S(q) curves from models in polyFTS. 

RunRPA.py and RunRPA_simple.py are two example scripts of how to use RPAFit.py.

Note: These output backup.json and backup.pickle files that we will be using to save fit information.
